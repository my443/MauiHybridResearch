# Maui Blazor Hybrid Research App

The purpose of this app is to find out how to create a Blazor Hybrid app using Maui. 

At the end of the day I hope to: 
[ ] Create a windows todo app that uses SQLite. 
[ ] Have the same app run on Android. 
[ ] See if I can have the SQLite file be on Google Drive or OneDrive so that data can be shared between the two. 

If I succeed in these three items, this research project will be complete.
